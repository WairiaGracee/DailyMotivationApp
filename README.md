This is an app built on mobile-first approach. Its functionality is to fetch a random quote form an API and display it on the user's screen on pressing the New Quote button.
Every time the user presses the button a new quote appears on the quote box.
It also has an add or save to favorites button, so the user can have a list of their favorite quotes stored in an array.
